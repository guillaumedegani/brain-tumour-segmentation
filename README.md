# Brain Tumour Segmentation and Classification

The idea behind this project was to developpe a process similar to what would happen at a hospital. Simply put a patient would get an MRI a deep learning model would then be tasked to find the tumor in the MRI if it exsist. Once the tumour is found we proceed by doing some feature extraction and with these feature we can apply a Machine Learning Model to classifie the tumour.
